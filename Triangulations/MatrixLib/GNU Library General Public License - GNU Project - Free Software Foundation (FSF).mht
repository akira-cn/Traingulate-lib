Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It is
 numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]
</PRE>
<H2><A href=3D"http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/library.html#TOC2"=20
name=3DSEC2>Preamble</A></H2>
<P>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom =
to=20
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are =
intended=20
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make =
sure the=20
software is free for all its users. </P>
<P>This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some =
specially=20
designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries =
whose=20
authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. </P>
<P>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not =
price. Our=20
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the =
freedom to=20
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you =
wish),=20
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can =
change=20
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know =
you can=20
do these things. </P>
<P>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid =
anyone to=20
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These =
restrictions=20
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies =
of the=20
library, or if you modify it. </P>
<P>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis =
or for a=20
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You =
must make=20
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a =
program=20
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the =
recipients so=20
that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the =
library=20
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know =
their=20
rights. </P>
<P>Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the =

library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission =
to=20
copy, distribute and/or modify the library. </P>
<P>Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that =

everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If =
the=20
library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its =
recipients to=20
know that what they have is not the original version, so that any =
problems=20
introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' =
reputations. </P>
<P>Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software =
patents. We=20
wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will=20
individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the =
program=20
into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that =
any=20
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. =
</P>
<P>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the =
ordinary GNU=20
General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This =
license,=20
the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated =
libraries.=20
This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read =
it in=20
full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the =
ordinary=20
license. </P>
<P>The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is =
that they=20
blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a =
program=20
and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing =
the=20
library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to =
running=20
a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and =
legal sense,=20
the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original =
library,=20
and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. </P>
<P>Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General =
Public=20
License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, =
because most=20
developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker =
conditions might=20
promote sharing better. </P>
<P>However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the =
users of=20
those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries =
themselves.=20
This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of =
non-free=20
programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user =
of such=20
programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We =
have=20
not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we =
have=20
achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) =
The hope=20
is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. </P>
<P>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and =
modification=20
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on =
the=20
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code =
derived=20
from the library, while the latter only works together with the library. =
</P>
<P>Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary =
General=20
Public License rather than by this special one. </P>

CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>
<P><STRONG>0.</STRONG> This License Agreement applies to any software =
library=20
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other =
authorized party=20
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General =
Public=20
License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as =
"you".=20
<P>A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data =
prepared so=20
as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some =
of those=20
functions and data) to form executables.=20
<P>The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work =
which has=20
been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means =
either=20
the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, =
a work=20
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with =
modifications=20
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, =

translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)=20
<P>"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for =
making=20
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the =
source=20
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface =
definition=20
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of =
the=20
library.=20
<P>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not =
covered=20
by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a =
program using=20
the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered =
only if=20
its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the =
use of=20
the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on =
what the=20
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.=20
<P><STRONG>1.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of =
the=20
Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, =
provided that=20
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate=20
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices =
that=20
refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute =
a copy=20
of this License along with the Library.=20
<P>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and =
you may=20
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.=20
<P><STRONG>2.</STRONG> You may modify your copy or copies of the Library =
or any=20
portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and =
distribute=20
such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided =
that you=20
also meet all of these conditions: <!-- we use this doubled UL to get =
the sub-sections indented, --><!-- while making the bullets as unobvious =
as possible. -->

  notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. =

licensed at=20
  no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.=20
  <P></P>
  <LI><STRONG>d)</STRONG> If a facility in the modified Library refers =
to a=20
  function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program =
that uses=20
  the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is =
invoked,=20
  then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an =

  application does not supply such function or table, the facility still =

  operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains =
meaningful. (For=20
  example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose =
that is=20
  entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, =
Subsection 2d=20
  requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this =
function=20
  must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square =
root=20
  function must still compute square roots.) </LI></UL>These =
requirements apply to=20
the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are =
not=20
derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent =
and=20
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not =
apply to=20
those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you=20
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on =
the=20
Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this =
License,=20
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and =
thus to=20
each and every part regardless of who wrote it.=20
<P>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest =
your=20
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to =
exercise the=20
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works =
based on the=20
Library.=20
<P>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the =
Library with=20
the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a =
storage or=20
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of =
this=20
License.=20
<P><STRONG>3.</STRONG> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary =
GNU=20
General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the =
Library.=20
To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, =
so that=20
they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, =
instead of to=20
this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU =
General=20
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead =
if you=20
wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.=20
<P>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that =
copy,=20
so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent =
copies and=20
derivative works made from that copy.=20
<P>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the =
Library=20
into a program that is not a library.=20
<P><STRONG>4.</STRONG> You may copy and distribute the Library (or a =
portion or=20
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form =
under the=20
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the =
complete=20
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed =
under the=20
terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for =
software=20
interchange.=20
<P>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy =
from a=20
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source =
code from=20
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, =
even=20
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the =
object=20
code.=20
<P><STRONG>5.</STRONG> A program that contains no derivative of any =
portion of=20
the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled =
or=20
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, =
in=20
isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls =
outside=20
the scope of this License.=20
<P>However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library =
creates an=20
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains =
portions of=20
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable =
is=20
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for =
distribution of=20
such executables.=20
<P>When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file =
that is=20
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative =
work of=20
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is=20
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or =
if the=20
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not =
precisely=20
defined by law.=20
<P>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure =
layouts=20
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or =
less in=20
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of =
whether=20
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object =
code plus=20
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)=20
<P>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may =
distribute the=20
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables=20
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are =
linked=20
directly with the Library itself.=20
<P><STRONG>6.</STRONG> As an exception to the Sections above, you may =

compile or link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to =

your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for =
the=20

modifications.=20
